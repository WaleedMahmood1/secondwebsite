Hi My name is Waleed Mahmood. I am currently a student at MDS-Vancouver. I completed my undergraduate in Economics in 2022. 
After graduating I worked for 1 year in academia with an international team to implement an intervention in rural Pakistan on Child Growth Monitoring in order to reduce child stunting rates.
